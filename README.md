# face_recognition

This code implements a face recognition model in PyTorch using the ResNet model. The code loads the LFWPairs dataset, loads the ResNet model, and trains the model on the dataset. The model is trained for 10 epochs using the cross-entropy loss function and the stochastic gradient descent optimizer. The code also prints the accuracy of the model after each epoch.

Once the model is trained, you can use the model to predict whether two images belong to the same person.
